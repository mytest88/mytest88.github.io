            In this project, I set up and deployed a fully automated Security Operations Center (SOC) within a virtual lab environment. The main challenge I tackled was the inherent inefficiency of manual incident detection and response. My solution brings together Wazuh (XDR/EDR) for thorough endpoint monitoring, TheHive (Incident Response) for organized incident management, and Shuffle (SOAR) for orchestrating automated workflows. By using Sysmon logs and creating custom rules, I built a robust system capable of simulating, detecting, and responding to advanced threats like Mimikatz in real-time. This setup shows my proactive approach. I transformed raw security events into actionable intelligence and automated critical response actions. Wazuh detected the threat, and the custom integration script successfully forwarded the alert to TheHive for immediate case management. Furthermore, automated email notifications were sent to the SOC analyst, enabling rapid case management. This automated alert creation significantly reduces response time and ensures critical incidents are promptly addressed, showcasing my ability to build resilient and efficient security operations.

                Here is the project workflow that minimizes manual intervention, ensuring that critical security incidents are detected, enriched with threat intelligence, escalated for case management, and communicated to the response team with unparalleled speed and efficiency. This project's success comes from a carefully designed automated workflow, ensuring rapid and consistent incident response. Here's a breakdown of the automated process:
              </p>

              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Endpoint Monitoring & Log Ingestion</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                A Windows 10 endpoint, equipped with Sysmon, generates security events. The Wazuh agent on the endpoint collects these Sysmon operational logs and forwards them to the Wazuh Manager. Wazuh is configured to ingest and archive all raw logs into Elasticsearch for comprehensive visibility and future analysis.
              </p>

              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Threat Detection & Custom Rule Creation</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                To detect specific threats like Mimikatz, I developed and put in place a custom Wazuh rule. This rule precisely identifies Mimikatz execution based on <code>originalFileName</code> within Sysmon event data, assigning a critical severity level and linking it to MITRE ATT&CK T1003 (OS Credential Dumping). Upon Mimikatz execution, Wazuh immediately generates a high-fidelity alert.
              </p>

              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Automated Incident Creation in TheHive</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                I developed and deployed a custom Python integration script on the Wazuh Manager. This script is configured in <code>ossec.conf</code> to automatically forward critical Wazuh alerts, including our Mimikatz detection, directly to TheHive. TheHive receives these alerts and automatically creates new cases for incident management, filling them with all relevant details from the Wazuh alert.
              </p>

              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">SOAR Orchestration & Threat Intelligence Enrichment (Shuffle)</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Wazuh alerts are also forwarded to Shuffle via a dedicated webhook. Shuffle's workflow automatically extracts the SHA256 hash from the Mimikatz alert data using a regex capture group. This extracted hash is then used to query VirusTotal via its API, enriching the alert with real-time threat intelligence and confirming the malicious nature of the executable.
              </p>

              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Automated Analyst Notification</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                As the final step in the Shuffle workflow, an automated email notification is sent to the analyst. This email, filled with critical alert details (e.g., alert title, filename, affected host), ensures immediate awareness and prompts the analyst to initiate their investigation in TheHive.

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Let's begin by installing Wazuh, the XDR/EDR platform, to establish core security monitoring and detection capabilities.

                The OOM Killer is a mechanism in the Linux kernel that steps in when the system is critically low on memory. It selects and terminates processes to free up memory and prevent the entire system from crashing or becoming unresponsive. Elasticsearch, especially with default configurations or when handling significant data, can be memory-intensive. How to solve this problem: 1. Increase Available Memory: The most direct solution is to provide more RAM to the machine running Elasticsearch. If possible, upgrade the system's memory. 2. Reduce Elasticsearch Memory Usage: If you can't increase the RAM, you need to configure Elasticsearch to use less memory. This involves adjusting the JVM heap size that Elasticsearch uses. My solution : I don't want to reduce the performance of Elasticsearch so i'm gonna increase the RAM of my VM. With the increased RAM, the Elasticsearch service now runs without OOM issues, allowing TheHive to start and authenticate correctly.

                The custom Python script, named custom-w2thive, is crucial for integrating Wazuh alerts with TheHive. The screenshot displays the script's content, which includes an HTTP POST request to TheHive's API, securely transmitting Wazuh alert data (e.g., rule ID, agent details, full log) to create new cases. This script acts as the bridge between Wazuh's detection capabilities and TheHive's incident management, ensuring seamless alert forwarding and automated case creation.

                To enable Wazuh to execute the custom Python integration script that forwards alerts to TheHive, I modified the ossec.conf file on the Wazuh Manager, adding a new &lt;integration&gt; block for custom-w2thive. Here we can see the configuration details: the hook_url is set to TheHive server's IP and port 9000, and a dedicated api_key is provided for authentication. The alert_format is specified as json to ensure structured data transfer.

                After restarting the Wazuh service, I navigated to TheHive's alert dashboard to verify the integration. The screenshot confirms that the Mimikatz alert was successfully received and a new case was created in TheHive. This confirms the seamless end-to-end integration: Wazuh detected the threat, and the custom integration script successfully forwarded the alert to TheHive for immediate case management. This automated alert creation significantly reduces response time and ensures critical incidents are promptly addressed.

                To ensure the analyst is immediately notified of critical incidents, I added a "Send email shuffle" action to our workflow. Here we can see the email configuration: the recipient is set to test@outlook.com, the subject line is "High Severity Alert!", and the body dynamically populates key alert details. This includes the alert title ($exec.title), the original filename ($exec.text.win.eventdata.originalFileName), and the affected host ($exec.text.win.system.computer). This automated email ensures timely communication and prompts the analyst to begin their investigation in TheHive.

                After the full workflow execution, here we can see the successful delivery of the automated email notification to the analyst. The email, sent by the "Shuffle Email App," has the subject "High Severity Alert!" and dynamically includes critical details: "Mimikatz Usage Detected!!! File name: mimikatz.exe activity on host DESKTOP-G6HR1ED." This final step in the SOAR playbook ensures that analysts are promptly informed of high-priority incidents, enabling them to initiate investigations swiftly.
