We are here to resolve the "Phising Unfolding" room from TryHackMe. This project is all about walking through a real-world phishing incident from start to finish. I'll be detailing my entire investigation process, from the moment a suspicious email alert popped up in our SIEM, right through to tracking the attacker's every move in Splunk. My goal here is to lay out how I approached this, what evidence I found, and how I pieced together the full attack chain to formulate a concrete remediation plan.            </div>

                <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Suspicious Email Alert</h3>
Here we can see the SIEM alert for a suspicious email. It includes an attachment named <code>ImportantInvoice-February.zip</code>, which was sent to <code>michael.ascot@tryhatme.com</code> from <code>john@hatmakereurope.xyz</code> with the subject "Important: Pending Invoice!". This email served as the initial entry point for the attack.
                <img

                  alt="Network Configuration Screenshot"
                  class="constrained-image"
                  id="image-2"
                  onclick="showOriginal(this)"
                />
              </div>
              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Checking the Attachment</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
After opening the <code>ImportantInvoice-February.zip</code> on the analyst VM, I saw was the <code>invoice.pdf.lnk</code> file. Knowing that these shortcut files can be tricky and often hide malicious commands, my immediate thought was to grab its file hashes. I used PowerShell to get the SHA256 and MD5 hashes of <code>invoice.pdf.lnk</code>. This way, I can quickly check these hashes against threat intelligence platforms to see if anyone else has seen this file before and if it's known to be bad. It's a quick way to get some initial context.
                <img
                  src="./assets/SocSim2/2-att.png"
                  alt="Netplan Apply Screenshot"
                  class="constrained-image"
                  id="image-3"

              </div>
              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Initial Threat Intelligence Check</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
So, after getting the hashes for <code>invoice.pdf.lnk</code>, I immediately popped these hashes into a threat intelligence platform. As you can see in the screenshot, it came back with no results in every search, meaning no one had reported this specific hash before. Now, it's really important to remember that just because a hash isn't found doesn't mean the file isn't malicious. This could just mean it's a very new variant, or perhaps it's highly targeted and hasn't been widely seen. It actually makes me even more suspicious, as attackers often try to generate unique hashes to evade detection. So, while this was a quick check, it certainly wasn't the end of my investigation.

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
After leveraging the threat intelligence tools provided within the simulator, I was able to confirm that the hrconnex.thm domain was not malicious. Based on this finding, the alert was classified as a 'False Positive'. Here you can see my final report entry.              </p>

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
Moving on to the next alert, I immediately noticed some unusual characteristics. The sender's domain, amazon.biz, appeared to be an impersonation attempt of a legitimate service. Furthermore, the email itself contained a shortened link, which is often a tactic used in malicious campaigns.              </p>
             <p class="project-details__desc-para"> 
             I started my initial checks with threat intelligence tools and it indicated that amazon.biz itself wasn't directly flagged as malicious. But this does not mean that we can automatically classify the alert as a false positive. My investigation then shifted to the shortened link within the email. My further analysis with threat intelligence tools confirmed that this link was indeed malicious.</p>
             <p class="project-details__desc-para"> 
             At this critical point, the next step of mine was to determine if the recipient, h.harris@thetrydaily.thm, had clicked on this malicious link and visited the associated address. To investigate this, I will definitely be leveraging the SIEM to examine relevant logs.</p>

<p class="project-details__desc-para">
<strong>* Recommended Remediation Actions</strong>
<br>Email Removal: Remove the malicious email from h.harris@thedailytry.thm's inbox to prevent further user interaction.
<br>User Notification/Awareness: Inform h.harris about the phishing attempt, emphasize that the link was blocked, and reinforce phishing awareness training. This is crucial for user education since they did click the link.
<br>URL Blacklisting: Ensure http://bit.ly/3sHkX3da12340 and amazon.biz (if not already) are blacklisted across relevant security controls (firewall, proxy, email filters) to prevent future access or similar attacks.
<br>Endpoint Verification: Confirm no other malicious activity originated from SourceIP: 10.20.2.17</p>

<strong>* List of Attack Indicators</strong>
<br>Sender Impersonation: urgents@amazon.biz (not official amazon.com)
<br>Malicious URL: http://bit.ly/3sHkX3da12340 (confirmed malicious by analysis and blocked by firewall rule Blocked Websites).

<strong>* Reason for Classifying as True Positive</strong>
<br>The email impersonates Microsoft (m1microsoftsupport.co instead of microsoft.com) and uses social engineering tactics ("Unusual Sign-In Activity") to trick the recipient. Investigation confirmed that the user clicked the malicious link, and the connection was ALLOWED by the firewall.</p>
<p class="project-details__desc-para">
<strong>* Reason for Escalating the Alert</strong>
<br>This is a confirmed successful phishing attempt where the user clicked a malicious link, and the connection was allowed. This indicates potential credential compromise or malware download, requiring immediate DFIR (Digital Forensics and Incident Response) and extensive remediation actions.</p>
<p class="project-details__desc-para">
<strong>* Recommended Remediation Actions</strong>
<br>Immediate User Contact to verify if they entered credentials on the fake site.
<br>Password Reset: Force password reset for c.allen's Microsoft account and any other accounts using the same or similar credentials.
<br>Endpoint Isolation/Investigation: Isolate SourceIP: 10.20.2.25 from the network. Conduct a full forensic investigation of the endpoint for malware, persistence mechanisms, and further compromise.
<br>Email Removal: Remove the malicious email from c.allen@thetrydaily.thm's inbox
<br>URL and Domain Blacklisting: Immediately blacklist m1microsoftsupport.co and https://m1microsoftsupport.co/login across all security controls (email gateway, firewall, proxy, EDR).
<br>Review M365 Logs: Check Microsoft 365/Azure AD logs for suspicious logins, password changes, or other activity from c.allen's account.</p>
<p class="project-details__desc-para">
<strong>* List of Attack Indicators</strong>
<br>Sender Impersonation: no-reply@m1microsoftsupport.co (not official Microsoft domain).
<br>Social Engineering: Urgent subject ("Unusual Sign-In Activity"), fear tactics, call to action ("secure your account immediately").
<br>Malicious URL: https://m1microsoftsupport.co/login (fraudulent login page).
<br>User Compromise Indicator: User c.allen clicked the malicious link from SourceIP: 10.20.2.25, and the connection was allowed by the firewall.</p>
