              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                In this project, a comprehensive virtual lab environment was built and operated to simulate Active Directory (AD) threats and analyze their impact using a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system. The primary challenge was to understand how advanced attacks target organizations and to confirm that security monitoring (<code>SIEM</code>) could effectively capture and detect these threats. A realistic domain was set up with a Windows Server acting as an Active Directory Domain Controller, a Windows 10 endpoint, and a Kali Linux machine for offensive operations. All network and system events were systematically collected and analyzed by Splunk, which was deployed on an Ubuntu server.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Through this lab, the ability to not only simulate common and advanced attack vectors, such as RDP brute-force and Atomic Red Team techniques (like local account creation and data exfiltration), but also to precisely track and analyze their telemetry in Splunk was demonstrated. This project provided crucial insights into how a well-configured <code>SIEM</code> provides exceptional visibility, even when attacks are unsuccessful. It was confirmed that Splunk effectively captured and indexed critical security events, providing crucial visibility into unauthorized access attempts and simulated adversary activities, which is fundamental for effective threat detection and incident response.

                Splunk Enterprise was installed on the Ubuntu server, ensuring it was configured with a static IP and set to start automatically on boot. Splunk Universal Forwarders were deployed on both the Windows Server (AD DC) and the Windows 10 Endpoint. The <code>input.conf</code> files on the Windows machines were configured to forward critical Windows Event Logs (Application, Security, System, and Sysmon Operational logs) to Splunk. In Splunk, dedicated indexes, <code>endpoint</code> and <code>ADserver</code>, were created to organize the incoming logs, and the receiving port (<code>9997</code>) was configured to accept data from the forwarders. Successful log ingestion was verified by searching for events from both Windows machines in Splunk.

                To collect security logs from the Windows machines (the Windows Server and Windows 10 Endpoint), the Splunk Universal Forwarder was installed on them. A key step in the Universal Forwarder setup wizard was configuring the "Receiving Indexer" by providing the hostname or IP address of the Splunk server, which is <code>192.168.10.12</code>, and the default receiving port, <code>9997</code>. This configuration ensures that the forwarder knows where to send the collected log data for analysis by Splunk.

The option "Only allow connections from computers running Remote Desktop with Network Level Authentication (recommended)" was unchecked. Disabling NLA allowed Hydra to proceed with the brute-force attempts without this initial authentication hurdle, enabling the simulation to continue as planned.

This indicates that PowerShell cannot find the <code>Invoke-AtomicTest</code> function, likely because the Atomic Red Team module is not properly loaded or its path is not in the PowerShell session's <code>$env:PSModulePath</code>. To resolve this, it was necessary to ensure that the PowerShell session was aware of where the <code>Invoke-AtomicTest</code> function resides. This typically involves importing the module or navigating to the directory where it's located before executing the command. The correct path to <code>Invoke-AtomicTest</code> will be provided to ensure the command runs successfully.

Following this, <code>Invoke-AtomicTest T1136.001</code> was re-executed to simulate creating a local account. There are some various sub-tests within this technique. While one test initially failed due to password policy requirements, other tests, such as "Create a new user in PowerShell" and "Create a new Windows admin user," completed successfully, as indicated by <code>Exit code: 0</code> and messages like "The command completed successfully". This demonstrates that Atomic Red Team is now correctly installed and capable of performing simulated attacks within the lab environment.

These events, particularly those with <code>Event Code 4720</code> (A user account was created) and <code>4728</code> (A member was added to a security-enabled global group), provide crucial forensic evidence of the simulated attack. This confirms that the <code>SIEM</code> is effectively capturing and logging the actions performed by Atomic Red Team, allowing detection and analysis of adversary emulation activities. It means if an attacker compromised the server and created a new user account, that activity can be detected as the telemetry generated can be seen.

The first sub-test, "<code>T1041-1 C2 Data Exfiltration</code>," attempted to use <code>Invoke-WebRequest</code> to send data to <code>example.com</code>. This particular test resulted in an "Access Denied" error, indicating that the simulated exfiltration to an external server was blocked, likely by network controls or the target server itself. The second sub-test, "<code>T1041-2 Text Based Data Exfiltration using DNS subdomains</code>," also encountered an error, specifically "<code>DNS name contains an invalid character</code>". This indicates an issue with the format of the DNS query used for exfiltration. Despite these specific failures, the execution of these tests is valuable. It generates relevant network and system logs that can now be analyzed in Splunk to identify patterns and indicators of attempted data exfiltration, even if the exfiltration itself was unsuccessful.
