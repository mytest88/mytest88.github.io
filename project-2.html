            Active Directory Threat Simulation and SIEM Analysis
          </h1>
          <p class="project-details__para">
            In this project, I built and operated a comprehensive virtual lab environment to simulate Active Directory (AD) threats and analyze their impact using a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system. [cite: 1] The primary challenge was to understand how advanced attacks target organizations and to confirm that our security monitoring (SIEM) could effectively capture and detect these threats. [cite: 2] I set up a realistic domain with a Windows Server acting as an Active Directory Domain Controller, a Windows 10 endpoint, and a Kali Linux machine for offensive operations. [cite: 3] All network and system events were systematically collected and analyzed by Splunk, which I deployed on an Ubuntu server. [cite: 4]
          </p>
          <p class="project-details__para">
            Through this lab, I demonstrated my ability to not only simulate common and advanced attack vectors, such as RDP brute-force and Atomic Red Team techniques (like local account creation and data exfiltration), but also to precisely track and analyze their telemetry in Splunk. [cite: 5] This project provided crucial insights into how a well-configured SIEM provides exceptional visibility, even when attacks are unsuccessful. [cite: 6] I confirmed that Splunk effectively captured and indexed critical security events, providing crucial visibility into unauthorized access attempts and simulated adversary activities, which is fundamental for effective threat detection and incident response. [cite: 7]

          <p class="project-details__para">
            This comprehensive workflow allowed me to simulate realistic attack scenarios and, crucially, to validate and demonstrate the effectiveness of Splunk as a SIEM solution in detecting, logging, and providing deep visibility into Active Directory-focused threats. [cite: 9] Here's a breakdown of the workflow I followed: [cite: 10]
          </p>

          <h3 class="heading-md heading-md--black project-details__heading">Virtual Lab Environment Setup</h3>
          <p class="project-details__para">
            I deployed essential virtual machines: a Windows Server as our Active Directory Domain Controller (192.168.10.15), a Windows 10 Endpoint (192.168.10.10) for user activity and attacks, and a Kali Linux machine (192.168.10.13) for offensive tools. [cite: 10] I configured an Ubuntu Server (192.168.10.12) to host our Splunk SIEM. [cite: 11]
          </p>

          <h3 class="heading-md heading-md--black project-details__heading">Splunk SIEM Deployment and Configuration</h3>
          <p class="project-details__para">
            I installed Splunk Enterprise on the Ubuntu server, ensuring it was configured with a static IP and set to start automatically on boot. [cite: 12] I deployed Splunk Universal Forwarders on both the Windows Server (AD DC) and the Windows 10 Endpoint. [cite: 13] I configured the input.conf files on the Windows machines to forward critical Windows Event Logs (Application, Security, System, and Sysmon Operational logs) to Splunk. [cite: 14] In Splunk, I created dedicated indexes, endpoint and ADserver, to organize the incoming logs and configured the receiving port (9997) to accept data from the forwarders. [cite: 15] I verified successful log ingestion by searching for events from both Windows machines in Splunk. [cite: 16]
          </p>

          <h3 class="heading-md heading-md--black project-details__heading">Active Directory Domain Setup</h3>
          <p class="project-details__para">
            I installed Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) on the Windows Server and promoted it to a domain controller, creating the hanlab.local forest. [cite: 17] I created new domain user accounts within Active Directory. [cite: 18] I configured the Windows 10 endpoint's DNS settings to point to the AD server and successfully joined it to the hanlab.local domain. [cite: 18]
          </p>

          <h3 class="heading-md heading-md--black project-details__heading">Threat Simulation: RDP Brute-Force Attack</h3>
          <p class="project-details__para">
            I prepared a password list on the Kali machine, including the target user's password. [cite: 19] I enabled Remote Desktop on the Windows 10 endpoint and granted RDP access to our domain users. [cite: 20] I executed an RDP brute-force attack using Hydra from the Kali machine against the Windows 10 endpoint. [cite: 21] I troubleshooted an initial connection error by disabling Network Level Authentication (NLA) on the target. [cite: 22] I analyzed the failed logon attempts (Event Code 4625) in Splunk, successfully identifying the Kali machine's IP as the source of the attack, demonstrating Splunk's ability to track malicious activity. [cite: 23]
          </p>

          <h3 class="heading-md heading-md--black project-details__heading">Threat Simulation: Atomic Red Team Attacks</h3>
          <p class="project-details__para">
            I prepared the Windows 10 endpoint for Atomic Red Team by adjusting the PowerShell execution policy and configuring Windows Defender exclusions. [cite: 24] I installed Atomic Red Team on the Windows 10 endpoint. [cite: 25] I executed T1136.001 (Create Account - Local Account) and verified the creation of new local user accounts by analyzing corresponding events in Splunk. [cite: 26] I executed T1041 (C2 Data Exfiltration) to simulate data exfiltration attempts. [cite: 27] Even though the exfiltration was blocked, I analyzed the generated telemetry in Splunk, highlighting the critical importance of seeing command-line arguments and attempted data in logs for early warning and forensic analysis.

          <p class="project-details__para">
            To begin setting up Splunk on the Ubuntu server, I first checked the network configuration using `ip a`. [cite: 32] The output confirms the current IP address of 192.168.10.6 for the `enp0s3` interface. [cite: 33] Following this, I initiated the process to configure a static IP address by opening the `50-cloud-init.yaml` file with `sudo nano /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml`. [cite: 34] This ensures Splunk has a consistent and predictable network address for reliable access and log ingestion. [cite: 35]

          <p class="project-details__para">
            To ensure a stable network presence for Splunk, I configured a static IP address for the Ubuntu server. [cite: 36] I edited the `/etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml` file, setting the `enp0s3` interface to `addresses: [192.168.10.12/24]` and specifying `nameservers: [8.8.8.8]` for DNS resolution. [cite: 37] After saving the changes, I applied the new configuration using `sudo netplan apply`. [cite: 38] This step ensures the Splunk server maintains its designated IP address. [cite: 39]

          <p class="project-details__para">
            When I attempted to execute the Atomic Red Team technique T1136.001 (Create Account - Local Account) using `Invoke-AtomicTest T1136.001`, I encountered an error stating, "The term 'Invoke-AtomicTest' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program". [cite: 113] This indicates that PowerShell cannot find the `Invoke-AtomicTest` function, likely because the Atomic Red Team module is not properly loaded or its path is not in the PowerShell session's `$env:PSModulePath`. [cite: 114] To resolve this, I need to ensure that the PowerShell session is aware of where the `Invoke-AtomicTest` function resides. [cite: 115] This typically involves importing the module or navigating to the directory where it's located before executing the command. [cite: 116] I will provide the correct path to `Invoke-AtomicTest` to ensure the command runs successfully. [cite: 117]

            To resolve the "command not recognized" error and successfully execute Atomic Red Team techniques, I explicitly imported the `Invoke-AtomicRedTeam` module. [cite: 118] I ran `Import-Module "C:\AtomicRedTeam\invoke-atomicredteam\Invoke-AtomicRedTeam.psd1"` to load the module into the PowerShell session. [cite: 119] Following this, I re-executed `Invoke-AtomicTest T1136.001` to simulate creating a local account. [cite: 120] There are some various sub-tests within this technique. [cite: 120] While one test initially failed due to password policy requirements, other tests, such as "Create a new user in PowerShell" and "Create a new Windows admin user," completed successfully, as indicated by `Exit code: 0` and messages like "The command completed successfully". [cite: 121] This demonstrates that Atomic Red Team is now correctly installed and capable of performing simulated attacks within our lab environment. [cite: 122]

          <p class="project-details__para">
            After successfully running the Atomic Red Team technique T1136.001 to create a local account, I verified the activity in Splunk. [cite: 123] I performed a search using `index="endpoint" NewLocalUser`. [cite: 124] This query specifically targets the endpoint index and looks for events related to the "NewLocalUser" account created by Atomic Red Team. [cite: 124] Here we can see that Splunk successfully identified 12 events associated with the creation of this new local user. [cite: 125] These events, particularly those with Event Code 4720 (A user account was created) and 4728 (A member was added to a security-enabled global group), provide crucial forensic evidence of the simulated attack. [cite: 126] This confirms that our SIEM is effectively capturing and logging the actions performed by Atomic Red Team, allowing us to detect and analyze adversary emulation activities. [cite: 127] It means if an attacker compromised our server and create a new user account we are able to detect that activity as we can see that the telemetry generated. [cite: 128]

          <p class="project-details__para">
            To further simulate advanced threats, I executed the Atomic Red Team technique T1041, which focuses on "C2 Data Exfiltration". [cite: 129] I ran `Invoke-AtomicTest T1041`. [cite: 130] The first sub-test, "T1041-1 C2 Data Exfiltration," attempted to use `Invoke-WebRequest` to send data to `example.com`. [cite: 130] This particular test resulted in an "Access Denied" error, indicating that the simulated exfiltration to an external server was blocked, likely by network controls or the target server itself. [cite: 131] The second sub-test, "T1041-2 Text Based Data Exfiltration using DNS subdomains," also encountered an error, specifically "DNS name contains an invalid character". [cite: 132] This indicates an issue with the format of the DNS query used for exfiltration. [cite: 133] Despite these specific failures, the execution of these tests is valuable. [cite: 134] It generates relevant network and system logs that we can now analyze in Splunk to identify patterns and indicators of attempted data exfiltration, even if the exfiltration itself was unsuccessful. [cite: 135] This helps in validating our SIEM's detection capabilities for such sophisticated attacks. [cite: 136]

            Here we can see that Splunk successfully captured 4 events related to this activity, even though the actual exfiltration attempt previously resulted in an "Access Denied" error. [cite: 139] This is incredibly important. The logs, specifically Sysmon events, provide crucial details: [cite: 139]
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>They show the `CommandLine` used, indicating `powershell.exe` attempting to connect to `example.com`. [cite: 140]</li>
            <li>They contain fields like `exfiltratedData` and `encodedData`, revealing the content that was attempted to be exfiltrated (e.g., "SecretDataToExfiltrate" in its encoded form). [cite: 141]</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="project-details__para">
            The ability to see this telemetry in Splunk is vital for the analyst. [cite: 142] Even if an attack is unsuccessful due to network controls or misconfigurations, the fact that our SIEM (Splunk) and endpoint logging (Sysmon via Universal Forwarder) capture these attempts provides: [cite: 143]
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>**Early Warning:** These logs serve as critical indicators of compromise (IOCs) and an attacker's intent, allowing us to detect malicious activity before it succeeds. [cite: 143]</li>
            <li>**Forensic Evidence:** The detailed information within these logs (source IP, command line, attempted data) is invaluable for post-incident analysis and understanding the adversary's techniques. [cite: 144]</li>
            <li>**Validation of Controls:** It confirms that our logging infrastructure is functioning correctly and that our SIEM is effectively collecting and indexing the necessary data to identify sophisticated attacks like data exfiltration attempts. [cite: 145]</li>
            <li>**Opportunity for Refinement:** This telemetry can be used to develop or refine detection rules, ensuring that future, similar attempts are immediately flagged and alerted upon. [cite: 146]</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="project-details__para">
            This demonstrates the power of a well-configured SIEM in providing deep visibility into endpoint activities, regardless of the attack's success, which is fundamental for effective threat detection and incident response. [cite: 147]
