              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                In this project, I built and operated a comprehensive virtual lab environment to simulate Active Directory (AD) threats and analyze their impact using a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system. [cite: 299] The primary challenge was to understand how advanced attacks target organizations and to confirm that our security monitoring (SIEM) could effectively capture and detect these threats. [cite: 300] I set up a realistic domain with a Windows Server acting as an Active Directory Domain Controller, a Windows 10 endpoint, and a Kali Linux machine for offensive operations. [cite: 301] All network and system events were systematically collected and analyzed by Splunk, which I deployed on an Ubuntu server. [cite: 302]
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Through this lab, I demonstrated my ability to not only simulate common and advanced attack vectors, such as RDP brute-force and Atomic Red Team techniques (like local account creation and data exfiltration), but also to precisely track and analyze their telemetry in Splunk. [cite: 303] This project provided crucial insights into how a well-configured SIEM provides exceptional visibility, even when attacks are unsuccessful. [cite: 304] I confirmed that Splunk effectively captured and indexed critical security events, providing crucial visibility into unauthorized access attempts and simulated adversary activities, which is fundamental for effective threat detection and incident response.

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                I installed Splunk Enterprise on the Ubuntu server, ensuring it was configured with a static IP and set to start automatically on boot. [cite: 310] I deployed Splunk Universal Forwarders on both the Windows Server (AD DC) and the Windows 10 Endpoint. [cite: 311] I configured the input.conf files on the Windows machines to forward critical Windows Event Logs (Application, Security, System, and Sysmon Operational logs) to Splunk. [cite: 312] In Splunk, I created dedicated indexes, endpoint and ADserver, to organize the incoming logs and configured the receiving port (9997) to accept data from the forwarders. [cite: 313] I verified successful log ingestion by searching for events from both Windows machines in Splunk. [cite: 314]

              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Setting Up Splunk: Network Configuration</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                To begin setting up Splunk on the Ubuntu server, I first checked the network configuration using `ip a`. [cite: 331] The output confirms the current IP address of 192.168.10.6 for the `enp0s3` interface. [cite: 332] Following this, I initiated the process to configure a static IP address by opening the `50-cloud-init.yaml` file with `sudo nano /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml`. [cite: 333] This ensures Splunk has a consistent and predictable network address for reliable access and log ingestion. [cite: 334]

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                To ensure a stable network presence for Splunk, I configured a static IP address for the Ubuntu server. [cite: 335] I edited the `/etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml` file, setting the `enp0s3` interface to `addresses: [192.168.10.12/24]` and specifying `nameservers: [8.8.8.8]` for DNS resolution. [cite: 336] After saving the changes, I applied the new configuration using `sudo netplan apply`. [cite: 337] This step ensures the Splunk server maintains its designated IP address. [cite: 338]

                To transfer the Splunk installation file to the Ubuntu server, I mounted a shared folder from my host PC. [cite: 339] I used the command `sudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=1000 Projects share/`, which successfully mounted the "Projects" shared folder to the "share/" directory on the Ubuntu machine. [cite: 340] Listing the directory contents with `ls -la` confirms that the "share" folder is now accessible, allowing me to easily transfer the Splunk installer on the VM. [cite: 341]

                To ensure Splunk automatically starts whenever the virtual machine boots, I configured it for boot-start. [cite: 348] I navigated to the `/opt/splunk/bin` directory and ran the command `sudo ./splunk enable boot-start -user splunk`. [cite: 349] This command installs an initialization script at `/etc/init.d/splunk`, which is then configured to run at boot. [cite: 350] This step automates Splunk's startup process, ensuring continuous log collection and analysis without manual intervention after a system restart. [cite: 351] I was then able to access the Splunk web interface. [cite: 352]

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                To ensure comprehensive log collection from the Windows machines, I modified the `input.conf` file located at `C:\Program Files\SplunkUniversalForwarder\etc\system\local`. [cite: 357] This configuration directs the Splunk Universal Forwarder to collect specific Windows Event Logs and forward them to our Splunk indexer. [cite: 358] As seen in the configuration, I enabled the collection of: [cite: 359]
                <ul>
                    <li>Application Logs (WinEventLog://Application)</li>
                    <li>Security Logs (WinEventLog://Security)</li>
                    <li>System Logs (WinEventLog://System)</li>
                    <li>Sysmon Operational Logs (WinEventLog://Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational)</li>
                </ul>
                For each of these, I set `index = endpoint` to route the data to a dedicated index in Splunk, and `disabled = false` to ensure they are actively collected. [cite: 359] Notably, for Sysmon logs, I also set `renderXml = true` and `source = XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational` to ensure the detailed XML structure of Sysmon events is preserved for richer analysis in Splunk. [cite: 360] This setup is crucial for gaining deep visibility into endpoint activities. [cite: 361]

                Here we can see that Splunk successfully captured 4 events related to this activity, even though the actual exfiltration attempt previously resulted in an "Access Denied" error. [cite: 442] This is incredibly important. [cite: 443] The logs, specifically Sysmon events, provide crucial details:
                <ul>
                    <li>They show the `CommandLine` used, indicating `powershell.exe` attempting to connect to example.com. [cite: 443]</li>
                    <li>They contain fields like `exfiltratedData` and `encodedData`, revealing the content that was attempted to be exfiltrated (e.g., "SecretDataToExfiltrate" in its encoded form). [cite: 444]</li>
                </ul>
                The ability to see this telemetry in Splunk is vital for the analyst. [cite: 445] Even if an attack is unsuccessful due to network controls or misconfigurations, the fact that our SIEM (Splunk) and endpoint logging (Sysmon via Universal Forwarder) capture these attempts provides:
                <ul>
                    <li>Early Warning: These logs serve as critical indicators of compromise (IOCs) and an attacker's intent, allowing us to detect malicious activity before it succeeds. [cite: 446]</li>
                    <li>Forensic Evidence: The detailed information within these logs (source IP, command line, attempted data) is invaluable for post-incident analysis and understanding the adversary's techniques. [cite: 447]</li>
                    <li>Validation of Controls: It confirms that our logging infrastructure is functioning correctly and that our SIEM is effectively collecting and indexing the necessary data to identify sophisticated attacks like data exfiltration attempts. [cite: 448]</li>
                    <li>Opportunity for Refinement: This telemetry can be used to develop or refine detection rules, ensuring that future, similar attempts are immediately flagged and alerted upon. [cite: 449]</li>
                </ul>
                This demonstrates the power of a well-configured SIEM in providing deep visibility into endpoint activities, regardless of the attack's success, which is fundamental for effective threat detection and incident response. [cite: 450]
