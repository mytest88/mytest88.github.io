              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                In this project, a comprehensive virtual lab environment was built and operated to simulate Active Directory (AD) threats and analyze their impact using a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system. The primary challenge was to understand how advanced attacks target organizations and to confirm that security monitoring (<code>SIEM</code>) could effectively capture and detect these threats. A realistic domain was set up with a Windows Server acting as an Active Directory Domain Controller, a Windows 10 endpoint, and a Kali Linux machine for offensive operations. All network and system events were systematically collected and analyzed by Splunk, which was deployed on an Ubuntu server.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Through this lab, the ability to not only simulate common and advanced attack vectors, such as RDP brute-force and Atomic Red Team techniques (like local account creation and data exfiltration), but also to precisely track and analyze their telemetry in Splunk was demonstrated. This project provided crucial insights into how a well-configured <code>SIEM</code> provides exceptional visibility, even when attacks are unsuccessful. It was confirmed that Splunk effectively captured and indexed critical security events, providing crucial visibility into unauthorized access attempts and simulated adversary activities, which is fundamental for effective threat detection and incident response.

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Essential virtual machines were deployed: a Windows Server as the Active Directory Domain Controller (<code>192.168.10.15</code>), a Windows 10 Endpoint (<code>192.168.10.10</code>) for user activity and attacks, and a Kali Linux machine (<code>192.168.10.13</code>) for offensive tools. An Ubuntu Server (<code>192.168.10.12</code>) was configured to host the Splunk <code>SIEM</code>.

              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Splunk SIEM Deployment and Configuration</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Splunk Enterprise was installed on the Ubuntu server, ensuring it was configured with a static IP and set to start automatically on boot. Splunk Universal Forwarders were deployed on both the Windows Server (AD DC) and the Windows 10 Endpoint. The <code>input.conf</code> files on the Windows machines were configured to forward critical Windows Event Logs (Application, Security, System, and Sysmon Operational logs) to Splunk. In Splunk, dedicated indexes, <code>endpoint</code> and <code>ADserver</code>, were created to organize the incoming logs, and the receiving port (<code>9997</code>) was configured to accept data from the forwarders. Successful log ingestion was verified by searching for events from both Windows machines in Splunk.

              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Active Directory Domain Setup</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) was installed on the Windows Server and it was promoted to a domain controller, creating the <code>hanlab.local</code> forest. New domain user accounts were created within Active Directory. The Windows 10 endpoint's DNS settings were configured to point to the AD server, and it was successfully joined to the <code>hanlab.local</code> domain.

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                A password list was prepared on the Kali machine, including the target user's password. Remote Desktop was enabled on the Windows 10 endpoint and RDP access was granted to domain users. An RDP brute-force attack was executed using Hydra from the Kali machine against the Windows 10 endpoint. An initial connection error was troubleshooted by disabling Network Level Authentication (NLA) on the target. Failed logon attempts (<code>Event Code 4625</code>) were analyzed in Splunk, successfully identifying the Kali machine's IP as the source of the attack, demonstrating Splunk's ability to track malicious activity.

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                The Windows 10 endpoint was prepared for Atomic Red Team by adjusting the PowerShell execution policy and configuring Windows Defender exclusions. Atomic Red Team was installed on the Windows 10 endpoint. <code>T1136.001</code> (Create Account - Local Account) was executed, and the creation of new local user accounts was verified by analyzing corresponding events in Splunk. <code>T1041</code> (C2 Data Exfiltration) was executed to simulate data exfiltration attempts. Even though the exfiltration was blocked, the generated telemetry in Splunk was analyzed, highlighting the critical importance of seeing command-line arguments and attempted data in logs for early warning and forensic analysis.

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                To begin setting up Splunk on the Ubuntu server, the network configuration was first checked using <code>ip a</code>. The output confirmed the current IP address of <code>192.168.10.6</code> for the <code>enp0s3</code> interface. Following this, the process to configure a static IP address was initiated by opening the <code>50-cloud-init.yaml</code> file with <code>sudo nano /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml</code>. This ensures Splunk has a consistent and predictable network address for reliable access and log ingestion.

                To ensure a stable network presence for Splunk, a static IP address was configured for the Ubuntu server. The <code>/etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml</code> file was edited, setting the <code>enp0s3</code> interface to <code>addresses: [192.168.10.12/24]</code> and specifying <code>nameservers: [8.8.8.8]</code> for DNS resolution. After saving the changes, the new configuration was applied using <code>sudo netplan apply</code>. This step ensures the Splunk server maintains its designated IP address.

                To transfer the Splunk installation file to the Ubuntu server, a shared folder from the host PC was mounted. The command <code>sudo mount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=1000 Projects share/</code> was used, which successfully mounted the "Projects" shared folder to the "share/" directory on the Ubuntu machine. Listing the directory contents with <code>ls -la</code> confirms that the "share" folder is now accessible, allowing easy transfer of the Splunk installer on the VM.

                To collect security logs from the Windows machines (the Windows Server and Windows 10 Endpoint), the Splunk Universal Forwarder was installed on them. A key step in the Universal Forwarder setup wizard was configuring the "Receiving Indexer" by providing the hostname or IP address of the Splunk server, which is <code>192.168.10.12</code>, and the default receiving port, <code>9997</code>. This configuration ensures that the forwarder knows where to send the collected log data for analysis by Splunk.

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                To ensure comprehensive log collection from the Windows machines, the <code>input.conf</code> file located at <code>C:\Program Files\SplunkUniversalForwarder\etc\system\local</code> was modified. This configuration directs the Splunk Universal Forwarder to collect specific Windows Event Logs and forward them to the Splunk indexer. As seen in the configuration, the collection of:
                <ul>
                    <li style="font-size: 1.6rem;">Application Logs (<code>WinEventLog://Application</code>)</li>
                    <li style="font-size: 1.6rem;">Security Logs (<code>WinEventLog://Security</code>)</li>
                    <li style="font-size: 1.6rem;">System Logs (<code>WinEventLog://System</code>)</li>
                    <li style="font-size: 1.6rem;">Sysmon Operational Logs (<code>WinEventLog://Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational</code>)</li>
                </ul>
                For each of these, <code>index = endpoint</code> was set to route the data to a dedicated index in Splunk, and <code>disabled = false</code> was set to ensure they are actively collected. Notably, for Sysmon logs, <code>renderXml = true</code> and <code>source = XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational</code> were also set to ensure the detailed XML structure of Sysmon events is preserved for richer analysis in Splunk. This setup is crucial for gaining deep visibility into endpoint activities.
